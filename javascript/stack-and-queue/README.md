# Stacks and Queues

> A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.
> A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). 

## Challenge

* Create a Stack class that has a top property.
* Create a Queue class that has a front property. 



## Approach & Efficiency
write the problem domaine and the algoritheme of the code then write the code stipe by stipe and test it.

## API
**push** : adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
**pop**: Removes the node from the top of the stack
**peek** : Returns: Value of the node located at the top of the stack
**isEmpty**: Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.
**enqueue** : adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
**dequeue** : Removes the node from the front of the queue
