## Challenge


> Implement a queue by using two instance of a Stack class.
> One of them is used for enqueue and the second one is for dequeue.
> Create a new PseudoQueue class.
> Stack instances have only push, pop, and peek methods.


## Approach & Efficiency
write the problem domaine and the algoritheme of the code then write the code stipe by stipe and test it.

## API
**enqueue(value)**: which inserts value into the PseudoQueue using a first-in,first-out approach.
**dequeue()**: which exracts a value from the PseudoQueue using a first-in,first-out approach.
**peek** : Returns: Value of the node located at the top of the stack
