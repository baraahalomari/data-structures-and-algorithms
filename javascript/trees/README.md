## Challenge


> Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node
> Create a Binary Search Tree class 
> Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search 
> Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least 


## Approach & Efficiency
write the problem domaine and the algoritheme of the code then write the code stipe by stipe and test it.

Note : I worked as a group with my colleagues . 

## API
